## Irene Scott's Portfolio Website
Hope your day has gone great so far and welcome to my portfolio website! Here you will be able to find
my best projects showcased using YouTube videos and links to see the projects live online. Previews of my technical blog are featured at the bottom of this webpage.
You'll also find ways to contact me, an about me section, and a list of my technical
skillset which is costantly expanding.

I am currently looking for job opportunities remote or non-remote around the globe. If you have any
questions about my background or skillset please feel free to contact me!
