This question is actually the most frequently asked question I receive whenever people ask what I do for a living and I tell them I am in the midst of completing a coding bootcamp. Mainly I decided to study software engineering becuase it matches my strengths in a career, it facinates me, and because I wanted a challenging but collaborative teamwork environment.

My strengths when working at any work environment include being good at explaining concepts, asking the right questions, having  what I like to call a "builder mindset", picking up on details quickly, and having skills at working with others effectively, as that is something I enjoy doing. Before I started this bootcamp, I believed that having these sort of strengths would bring me success in coding bootcamp. In other words, I knew that if I had the foundations for what I believed would be useful, then of course that would be one of my best reasons for wanting to study it and build a career out of it.

I studied successful people before I started this course and came to realize quickly that people don't do things they know they are not innately good at doing because they want to set themselves up for the best chance of success. For instance, I wouldn't study fashion modeling because I don't have the best sense in fashion neither the interest for it.

The concept of building something to make a computer system work truly does make my eyes and my mind light up. I think it is amazing that we as imperfect humans, can write instructions in a computer's mechanical language to make it do things that humans cannot do themselves.

Humans cannot have forms available at any hour of the night for customers to fill out because they only work certain hours of the day. However humans can write code to create a website to do just that. Humans can't just search through thousands, if not millions of records out of all the citizens in a large area just to find a certain percentage of qualities out of a population, but they can program a computer to do this for them. Hence the name software engineer, they are engineering ways to do these types of things. The idea that I can be that creative human in each of those instances facinates me.

My previous job positions I have held before starting this bootcamp have sometimes consisted of me working alone and sometimes have consisted of me working with others, so I have had a taste of working in both kind of environments. I can firmly say that working with others is always a whole lot better from my perspective. This is because it gives me this overwhelming sense of satisfaction when I know that I have done what is morally good to help others, it helps me to catch my mistakes better in what I am working on, and it helps me to develop better listening skills to make whatever we are working on as a team better.

It is evident to me that almost anything that has ever been admired in this world, major box office success movies, social media websites, even creating a well rounded family, has always been done by teamwork. In software engineering you cannot just work alone, it is all about working with other developers to create something great and that is one of my greatest motivators for wanting to study, along with the idea that Flatiron's bootcamp gives me that kind of environement.

Learning to code is not an easy task by any means and I knew this before I started the bootcamp because I already did some independent coding projects myself beforehand. I knew what I was getting into and I wanted that kind of challenge. The structure of a coding bootcamp in itself is also a challenge and I knew that was the right next step forward in wanting to do this to invest in myself. Speaking from experience I also really wanted a challenge because my other jobs did not feel challenging enough, and I think having work be a challenge makes it far more engaging.

It is only week 2 of this coding bootcamp and my desire to learn is still going strong. Of course there are those times when I feel like what I am trying to learn is too hard, but I just try my best to ignore that voice in my head and keep going because I have my rational/strong reasons why I am doing this which I couldn't be more proud of having. With this kind of mindset when I finish the bootcamp, I can answer that same question people will ask me with the actual experiences I have here to give them a clearer picture on why I did it.
