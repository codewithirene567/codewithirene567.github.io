								<p>Out of a love for animals and to entertain users, I decided it would be a unique idea to be able to make this site to let users create their
									own accounts to let them create their own animals, so that they could share reasons for liking that animal with the rest of the users.</p>
									
									<p>There is also a way
									for users to give other people's animals reasons for liking them as well. It was coded with Ruby on Rails as a framework to organize the code
									with HTML and CSS for styling.</p>
									
									<p>Alternatively, this website also features Google OAuth so that users can sign in with their Google accounts instead of making a username and password.

									<h2>About</h2>
									<h5>Hi there I'm Irene. I'm a full stack software developer based in sunny Tampa, Florida.
										You can call me a full stack developer, a great team player, a problem-solver, or
										an effective communicator, even a comedian, but the one thing you can't call me is lazy because
										I love what I do and when you love what you do, it's hard to be lazy. </h5>

										<p>I'm originally from where the stars live (Los Angeles) and I'm a grad from the Flatiron School's software engineering program,
										an intensive course that improved my skills as a programmer from the self-taught projects I worked on beforehand. The most important
										skill I learned from there was not any of the coding, but rather how to solve problems which
										is really what software engineering is; solving problems. </p>
										
										<p>In terms of my working style I would say that I bring plenty of positive energy to the table
										with good conversation, a hard work ethic, high levels of integrity, and especially teamwork. To elaborate on that last part,
										in my eyes it is evident, that almost anything that has ever been admired in this world,
										i.e. a major box office movie success,
										social media websites, even creating a well-rounded family, have been a team effort.
										To put it simply, I believe software development is all about collaboration and working hard to find solutions
										for clients/customers
										and those are two of my favorite parts of what successful software development looks like although there are plenty
										more.</p>
										
										<p>My fascination with software development and my knack for solving problems gives me the fuel to continue
										to constantly learn new technologies and constantly improve myself in the world of software development. I often passionately write about projects I've built and coding concepts through 
										my blogs.</p>

										<p>I am currently seeking full stack, front-end, or back-end opportunities anywhere around the globe. Feel free to connect
										with me or see what I have to offer through looking at my  <a href="#portfolio">portfolio projects</a> or reading my <a href="#blog">blogs!</a>
										</p>
